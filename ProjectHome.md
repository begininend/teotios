**Information**

We have decided to release this code to the public to help promote a learning environment for the Flex 4 Spark framework and itâ€™s component design patterns.

**Note:** Although this code is open source, it is actively developed and supported in conjunction with our commercial products.

**Suggestions are welcome for new components added to the library!**

Just post comments or get a hold of me through our company site.

**Donations**

I work on certain branches of the ui.common library in my own spare time. If you find things helpful, learn something or use this code in a commercial product, feel free to drop a dime of support.

The ui.navigator library is a completely spare time project.

Thanks,
Mike
